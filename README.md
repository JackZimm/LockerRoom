A Sports Media Website - https://www.lrsblogging.com

This is a project that I worked on to grow my ability as a fullstack developer. It uses PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS in order to create a full and responsive website.
There is a front-end that is for users to see different stories and bets that are going on around the league(s), a page view counter on each post to track activity, and coming soon is a comment feature to increase community engagement.

There is also a backend for the admins to create posts, add new users to the team, and eventually a way to filter comments to kepp the comments clean. 

This project is ever growing as I learn more and better ways to keep creating an learning.
